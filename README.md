# README

The Nand2tetris Software Suite consists of two folders: projects, and tools.


_The projects folder_ is divided into 14 project folders named 00, 01, ..., 13. These folders contain files that you have to modify and complete as you work on various nand2tetris projects.


_The tools folder_ contains the nand2tetris software tools. It's a collection of programs and files that will be explained as you follow the various projects.


The remainder of this section should be used as reference; there is no need to read what follows until you will be asked to use a particular software tool.


**The .bat and .sh files** are batch and script files, used to invoke the nand2tetris software tools. These files are explained in detail below.


**The bin folder** contains the code of the nand2tetris software tools. It consists of several sub-folders containing Java class files and supporting files.


**The builtInChips and the builtInVMCode folders** contain files that are used by the supplied Hardware Simulator and VM Emulator, respectively.


**The OS folder** contains a compiled version of the Jack operating system.
